# Inter-LLM Mailbox System

A distributed messaging infrastructure that enables asynchronous communication between Large Language Model instances using Redis as the underlying pub/sub and storage engine.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Send and receive messages between LLM instances
- **Real-time Communication**: Pub/sub messaging with immediate delivery
- **Persistent Storage**: Store-and-forward messaging for offline participants
- **Topic-based Communication**: Group messaging with hierarchical topics
- **Security & Permissions**: Role-based access control and audit logging
- **Multiple Content Types**: Support for text, JSON, binary, and code content
- **Resilient Design**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful degradation

## Architecture

The system consists of four primary layers:

1. **Client Layer**: LLM instances connect through standardized client libraries
2. **API Layer**: RESTful and WebSocket APIs for message operations
3. **Core Layer**: Message routing, subscription management, and permission enforcement
4. **Storage Layer**: Redis-based persistence and pub/sub infrastructure
