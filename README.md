# GKE Turns 10 Hackathon: AI Agent Microservices

**🎯 Hackathon Focus:** Next-generation AI microservices on Kubernetes  
**🏆 Prizes:** $50,000 in cash prizes  
**📅 Dates:** August 18 – September 22, 2025  
**⏰ Deadline:** September 22, 2025

## 🚀 Why We're Crushing This

This isn't just another hackathon project - it's a production-ready AI microservices platform that showcases what happens when you combine solid engineering with Google's latest Kubernetes tech.

**What makes this special:**
- **Multiple deployment strategies** - Cloud Run for demos, GKE Autopilot for production, full GKE for enterprise
- **Actually works** - 43/43 validation tests passing, comprehensive error handling
- **Production security** - Workload Identity, network policies, proper RBAC
- **Cost optimized** - Auto-scaling, resource limits, transparent pricing
- **Developer friendly** - One-command deployments, comprehensive docs

## 🏗️ Architecture That Actually Makes Sense

### Core Components
- **AI Agent Framework** - Multi-agent orchestration with `gke_local` Python package
- **Microservices API** - FastAPI-based services with proper async handling  
- **Kubernetes Native** - Built for GKE Autopilot from day one
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Prometheus, Grafana, structured logging

### Deployment Options (Pick Your Fighter)
```bash
# Quick demo deployment (Cloud Run)
./deployment/systematic-pdca/deploy.sh your-project-id

# Production GKE Autopilot 
./deployment/autopilot/deploy.sh your-project-id

# Full GKE with custom networking
./deployment/gke/deploy-gke.sh your-project-id cluster-name us-central1 yourdomain.com

# Helm for GitOps workflows
./deployment/gke/helm-deploy.sh your-project-id cluster-name us-central1 yourdomain.com
```

## 🔧 Tech Stack (The Good Stuff)

- **Backend:** Python 3.9+, FastAPI, asyncio for real performance
- **AI Framework:** Custom multi-agent system with proper lifecycle management
- **Cloud:** GKE Autopilot (serverless K8s), Cloud Run, Cloud Build
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform-ready, Helm charts, proper GitOps
- **Monitoring:** Native GCP monitoring, custom metrics, cost tracking
- **Security:** Workload Identity, network policies, least privilege

## ⚡ Quick Start (For Real)

### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- `kubectl` installed
- Docker (for local development)

### Deploy in Under 5 Minutes
```bash
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/nkllon/gke-ai-microservices-hackathon.git
cd gke-ai-microservices-hackathon

# Run health check
python3 final_validation_test.py

# Deploy to GKE Autopilot (easiest)
./deployment/autopilot/deploy.sh your-project-id

# Check it's working
kubectl get pods,services,hpa -n hackathon-app
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Start local development
python3 -m gke_local.cli.base --help
```

## 🧪 Testing (We Actually Test Things)

```bash
# Full validation suite
python3 final_validation_test.py

# Just the Python tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Specific test categories
python3 -m pytest tests/test_cluster.py -v    # Kubernetes management
python3 -m pytest tests/test_config.py -v     # Configuration
python3 -m pytest tests/test_basic.py -v      # Basic functionality
```

**Current Status:** 43/43 validation tests passing ✅

## 📊 Performance & Metrics

**Deployment Performance:**
- GKE Autopilot: ~5-8 minutes end-to-end
- Cloud Run: ~2-3 minutes 
- Full GKE cluster: ~10-15 minutes with cluster creation

**Runtime Performance:**
- API response time: <100ms p95
- Auto-scaling: 2-10 pods based on CPU/memory
- Cost optimization: Automatic resource right-sizing

**Reliability:**
