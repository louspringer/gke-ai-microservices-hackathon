# Beast Mode Agent Network

The Beast Mode Agent Network provides a unified coordination layer for all multi-agent operations across the Beast Mode ecosystem. It integrates multi-agent consensus, distributed orchestration, and swarm coordination capabilities into a cohesive agent network that enables massive parallel development velocity while maintaining systematic quality.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

**Single Responsibility:** Unified agent network coordination and management  
**Architectural Position:** Integration layer above individual agent systems

The Agent Network serves as the central nervous system for Beast Mode operations, coordinating between:
- Multi-Agent Consensus Engine (decision making and conflict resolution)
- Multi-Instance Kiro Orchestration (distributed swarm management)
- Beast Mode Framework DAG agents (parallel task execution)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **NetworkCoordinator**: Central orchestration hub for all agent network operations
2. **AgentRegistry**: Unified registry of all active agents across different systems
3. **ConsensusOrchestrator**: Integration layer for Multi-Agent Consensus Engine
4. **SwarmManager**: Integration layer for Multi-Instance Kiro Orchestration
5. **DAGAgentCoordinator**: Integration layer for Beast Mode Framework DAG agents

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from src.beast_mode.agent_network import (
    NetworkCoordinator,
    AgentRegistry,
    ConsensusOrchestrator,
    SwarmManager,
    DAGAgentCoordinator,
    AgentInfo,
    AgentStatus
)

async def setup_agent_network():
    # Initialize core components
    coordinator = NetworkCoordinator()
    registry = AgentRegistry()
    
    # Initialize integration layers
    consensus = ConsensusOrchestrator()
    swarm = SwarmManager()
    dag = DAGAgentCoordinator()
    
    # Start all components
    await coordinator.start()
    await registry.start()
    await consensus.start()
    await swarm.start()
    await dag.start()
    
    # Register integrations
    coordinator.register_system_integration("consensus", consensus)
    coordinator.register_system_integration("orchestration", swarm)
    coordinator.register_system_integration("dag", dag)
    
    return coordinator, registry, consensus, swarm, dag

# Run the setup
coordinator, registry, consensus, swarm, dag = await setup_agent_network()
```

### Agent Registration and Discovery

```python
# Register agents
await registry.register_agent(
    agent_id="consensus_agent_1",
    system_type="consensus",
    capabilities=["voting", "analysis"],
    metadata={"version": "1.0", "specialization": "conflict_resolution"}
)

# Discover agents by capabilities
voting_agents = await registry.discover_agents(
    capabilities=["voting"],
    status=AgentStatus.ACTIVE,
    limit=5
)

# Update agent status
await registry.update_agent_status("consensus_agent_1", AgentStatus.ACTIVE)
```

### Multi-System Coordination

```python
# Coordinate across multiple systems
task_requirements = {
    "complexity": "high",
    "systems_required": ["consensus", "orchestration", "dag"],
    "capabilities": ["voting", "task_distribution", "parallel_execution"],
    "resources": {"cpu_cores": 8, "memory_gb": 16}
}

result = await coordinator.coordinate_multi_system_agents(task_requirements)
if result["success"]:
    print(f"Coordination completed in {result['coordination_time_ms']}ms")
```
