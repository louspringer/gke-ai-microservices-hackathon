# Beast Mode Agent Network Requirements

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Agent Network provides a unified coordination layer for all multi-agent operations across the Beast Mode ecosystem. This system integrates multi-agent consensus, distributed orchestration, and swarm coordination capabilities into a cohesive agent network that enables massive parallel development velocity while maintaining systematic quality.

**Single Responsibility:** Unified agent network coordination and management
**Architectural Position:** Integration layer above individual agent systems

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Agent Network Coordination

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode system, I want unified agent network coordination, so that all multi-agent operations work together seamlessly across different Beast Mode components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agent systems are active THEN the network SHALL coordinate between Multi-Agent Consensus Engine, Multi-Instance Kiro Orchestration, and Beast Mode Framework agents
2. WHEN agent conflicts arise THEN the network SHALL use systematic consensus mechanisms to resolve conflicts across all agent types
3. WHEN agents need resources THEN the network SHALL optimize resource allocation across all active agent systems
4. WHEN network coordination executes THEN it SHALL maintain systematic Beast Mode principles across all participating agents
5. WHEN coordination patterns succeed THEN they SHALL be learned and applied to future multi-agent scenarios

### Requirement 2: Distributed Agent Swarm Management

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode commander, I want distributed agent swarm management, so that I can coordinate massive parallel development campaigns across multiple agent types and deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN launching agent swarms THEN the network SHALL coordinate Multi-Instance Kiro agents, Consensus Engine agents, and Framework DAG agents
2. WHEN managing distributed swarms THEN the network SHALL support deployment across local, cloud, and hybrid environments
3. WHEN swarm coordination executes THEN the network SHALL maintain systematic communication protocols and structured actions
4. WHEN swarms scale THEN the network SHALL dynamically provision and manage agents based on workload and resource availability
5. WHEN measuring swarm effectiveness THEN the network SHALL provide comprehensive metrics across all agent types and deployment targets

### Requirement 3: Cross-System Agent Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want cross-system agent integration, so that agents from different Beast Mode components can work together on complex multi-system tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating agent systems THEN the network SHALL provide unified interfaces for Multi-Agent Consensus, Multi-Instance Orchestration, and Framework DAG agents
2. WHEN agents collaborate THEN the network SHALL enable seamless task handoffs between different agent types
3. WHEN managing agent lifecycles THEN the network SHALL coordinate agent creation, execution, and termination across all systems
4. WHEN ensuring quality THEN the network SHALL apply systematic validation and RCA across all integrated agent operations
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the network SHALL balance workloads across different agent types based on their capabilities

### Requirement 4: Systematic Agent Network Intelligence

**User Story:** As an intelligent agent network, I want systematic learning and optimization capabilities, so that the network becomes more effective over time through systematic improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents complete tasks THEN the network SHALL learn from success and failure patterns across all agent types
2. WHEN optimizing coordination THEN the network SHALL use systematic PDCA methodology to improve agent network performance
3. WHEN making decisions THEN the network SHALL use model-driven approaches based on accumulated agent performance data
4. WHEN detecting patterns THEN the network SHALL identify optimal agent combinations and coordination strategies
5. WHEN applying intelligence THEN the network SHALL systematically improve agent allocation, coordination, and conflict resolution

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coordinating agents THEN the network SHALL maintain <100ms coordination overhead for agent-to-agent communication
2. WHEN scaling swarms THEN the network SHALL support 100+ concurrent agents across all integrated systems
3. WHEN processing decisions THEN consensus and coordination SHALL complete within 1 second for standard scenarios
4. WHEN handling failures THEN the network SHALL recover and redistribute work within 30 seconds
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the network SHALL achieve >80% efficiency compared to theoretical maximum parallel speedup

### Derived Requirement 2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network operates THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime across all integrated agent systems
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the network SHALL provide graceful degradation and systematic recovery
3. WHEN agents fail THEN the network SHALL redistribute work without losing overall progress
4. WHEN recovering from failures THEN the network SHALL restore full functionality within 60 seconds
5. WHEN ensuring continuity THEN the network SHALL maintain systematic quality standards even during partial failures
