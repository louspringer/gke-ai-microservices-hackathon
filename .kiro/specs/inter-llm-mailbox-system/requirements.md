# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Inter-LLM Mailbox System enables asynchronous communication between different Large Language Model instances through a Redis pub/sub messaging infrastructure. This system creates a distributed network where LLMs can send messages, subscribe to topics, and maintain persistent mailboxes for reliable message delivery. The system supports both real-time communication and store-and-forward messaging patterns, enabling complex multi-agent AI workflows and collaborative problem-solving scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an LLM instance, I want to send messages to other LLM instances through named mailboxes, so that I can initiate asynchronous communication and collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM publishes a message to a named mailbox THEN the system SHALL store the message in Redis with proper routing metadata
2. WHEN a message is published THEN the system SHALL include sender identification, timestamp, and message type in the metadata
3. WHEN publishing a message THEN the system SHALL support both broadcast and direct addressing modes
4. IF the target mailbox does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
5. WHEN a message is successfully published THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation with message ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an LLM instance, I want to subscribe to specific mailboxes and receive messages in real-time, so that I can participate in ongoing conversations and respond to requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM subscribes to a mailbox THEN the system SHALL establish a persistent Redis subscription
2. WHEN a new message arrives in a subscribed mailbox THEN the system SHALL deliver it immediately to all subscribers
3. WHEN subscribing THEN the system SHALL support pattern-based subscriptions using wildcards
4. IF a subscriber disconnects THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection and message recovery gracefully
5. WHEN multiple LLMs subscribe to the same mailbox THEN the system SHALL deliver messages to all active subscribers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an LLM instance, I want to retrieve messages from my mailbox even when I was offline, so that I don't miss important communications and can catch up on conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM requests mailbox history THEN the system SHALL return all unread messages in chronological order
2. WHEN retrieving messages THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large message volumes
3. WHEN a message is read THEN the system SHALL mark it as read but retain it for audit purposes
4. IF an LLM was offline THEN the system SHALL persist messages for a configurable retention period
5. WHEN requesting specific message ranges THEN the system SHALL support time-based and ID-based filtering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage mailbox permissions and access controls, so that I can ensure secure communication between authorized LLM instances only.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a mailbox THEN the system SHALL support access control lists for read/write permissions
2. WHEN an unauthorized LLM attempts access THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log the attempt
3. WHEN configuring permissions THEN the system SHALL support role-based access control
4. IF security policies change THEN the system SHALL update permissions without service interruption
5. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of all mailbox operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an LLM instance, I want to participate in topic-based group communications, so that I can collaborate with multiple other LLMs on shared interests or projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN joining a topic THEN the system SHALL add the LLM to the topic's subscriber list
2. WHEN a message is published to a topic THEN the system SHALL deliver it to all topic subscribers
3. WHEN leaving a topic THEN the system SHALL remove the LLM from future message delivery
4. IF a topic becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL support automatic cleanup after a configurable period
5. WHEN managing topics THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical topic structures with inheritance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor system health and message flow metrics, so that I can ensure reliable operation and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide real-time metrics on message throughput and latency
2. WHEN checking system health THEN it SHALL report Redis connection status and resource utilization
3. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on mailbox activity and subscriber counts
4. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and diagnostic information
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging with configurable verbosity levels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an LLM instance, I want to send structured messages with different content types, so that I can share rich information including code, data, and multimedia references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a message THEN the system SHALL support multiple content types including text, JSON, and binary references
2. WHEN handling large payloads THEN the system SHALL support message chunking and reassembly
3. WHEN sending structured data THEN the system SHALL validate message format and provide error feedback
4. IF message size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL support external storage references with automatic cleanup
5. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL preserve content type information for proper deserialization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle failures gracefully and maintain message delivery guarantees, so that critical communications are not lost during outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages locally and retry delivery
2. WHEN network partitions occur THEN the system SHALL detect splits and maintain consistency when reconnected
3. WHEN a subscriber fails THEN the system SHALL continue message delivery to remaining subscribers
4. IF message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
5. WHEN system recovers from failure THEN it SHALL process queued messages in correct order without duplication
