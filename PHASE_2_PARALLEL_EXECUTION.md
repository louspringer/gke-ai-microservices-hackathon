# Phase 2: Parallel Execution Ready ðŸš€

## âœ… Task 1 Complete - Foundation Established

**Core project structure and configuration management** has been successfully implemented with:

- âœ… Comprehensive directory structure for all GKE Local components
- âœ… YAML-based configuration management with Pydantic validation  
- âœ… Extensible CLI framework with Click and command parsing
- âœ… Environment-specific configuration override system
- âœ… Complete test suite (9/9 tests passing)
- âœ… Documentation and examples

## ðŸ”€ Parallel Worktrees Created

Three worktrees have been created for parallel execution of Phase 2 infrastructure tasks:

### Task 2.1: Kind Cluster Management
**Worktree**: `../task-2.1-kind-cluster-management`  
**Branch**: `task-2.1-kind-cluster-management`  
**Focus**: Create Kind cluster management module
- Write Kind cluster creation and management utilities
- Implement cluster lifecycle management (start, stop, reset)
- Create cluster configuration templates with proper networking
- _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

### Task 2.2: Local Container Registry  
**Worktree**: `../task-2.2-local-container-registry`  
**Branch**: `task-2.2-local-container-registry`  
**Focus**: Implement local container registry
- Set up local Docker registry for fast image storage
- Create image push/pull utilities for local development
- Implement registry cleanup and management functions
- _Requirements: 1.1, 5.1_

### Task 2.3: Ingress Controller and Networking
**Worktree**: `../task-2.3-ingress-controller-networking`  
**Branch**: `task-2.3-ingress-controller-networking`  
**Focus**: Set up ingress controller and networking
- Deploy and configure ingress controller in Kind cluster
- Implement service discovery and routing mechanisms
- Create network policy templates for security simulation
- _Requirements: 1.3, 11.3_

## ðŸŽ¯ Execution Instructions for Agents

Each agent should:

1. **Navigate to assigned worktree directory**
2. **Read the complete spec context** (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
3. **Focus ONLY on their assigned task** - no cross-task implementation
4. **Update task status** to in_progress when starting
5. **Implement according to design document** specifications
6. **Test implementation** thoroughly
7. **Update task status** to completed when done
8. **Commit and push** to their branch
9. **Create merge request** back to main branch

## ðŸ”§ Available Foundation

All agents have access to the established foundation:
- Configuration management system (`gke_local/config/`)
- CLI framework (`gke_local/cli/`)
- Utility functions (`gke_local/utils/`)
- Project structure and packaging
- Test framework setup

## ðŸ“‹ Critical Path Dependencies

- **Task 3.1** (serverless simulation) depends on completion of Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
- All Phase 2 tasks can execute in parallel
- Each task builds essential infrastructure for the simulation layer

## ðŸš€ Beast Mode DNA Integration

This systematic approach ensures:
- **Zero rework** through proper dependency management
- **Maximum parallelization** of independent tasks
- **Production-ready quality** from the start
- **Comprehensive testing** at each step
- **Clear integration points** for merge back

**Ready for parallel Beast Mode execution! ðŸ§¬**
